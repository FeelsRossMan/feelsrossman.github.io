Evan Lahey is a former Sr. Process Engineer from the PCB industry. In July of 2022, Evan decided to leave his career as a Process Engineer to move across the country and explore alternative paths. Originally a NY native (more specifically the north shore of Long Island), Evan now lives outside of Seattle. 

While working as a Process Engineer, he honed several skills found across careers. Implementing new equipment required creating new processes, associated documentation, and effective training procedures. Troubleshooting existing issues honed general problem-solving skills, as well as the importance of working as a team with colleagues. Process optimizations required the creation of new methods of data analysis and taught that just because something works, doesn’t mean it can’t be improved. 

He is currently working on his skills as an Android Developer (on mostly personal projects) as well as spending time working on various open-source projects. With experience using various languages (Kotlin, C++, Javascript, Python, and more) Evan has completed many personal projects: including programming automatic home lighting systems, setting up servers to play video games with his friends, and android applications for personal use to name a few. He considers himself a dedicated learner and is always open to new information and opportunities.
