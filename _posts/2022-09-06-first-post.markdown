This is the first post on the website, as such I don't have much to talk about, except maybe the website itself. Setting up the website was pretty simple; there's a ton of information/tutorials on how to get everything up and running. The hardest part about this is deciding what to add. This was also my first experience with Ruby, YAML, and markdown files. I didn't do much with Ruby, but that might come up later if I ever use Ruby on Rails or something. YAML and markdown are both fairly straightforward, and to be honest, I'm pretty glad I don't have to do the HTML for all of this.

The plan for the website is to post once a week on Friday. The content will be sort of a list of things done that week with some thoughts and ideas associated with them. I'm currently working on a simple app for finding a random apex character, so maybe it'll be about how that went. All for now.
